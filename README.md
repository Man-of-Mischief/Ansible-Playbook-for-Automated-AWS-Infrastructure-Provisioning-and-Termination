# Ansible-Playbook-for-Automated-AWS-Infrastructure-Provisioning-and-Termination
This repository contains an Ansible playbook for automating the creation and provisioning of AWS infrastructure. The playbook provisions EC2 instances, sets up security groups, and configures the instances for hosting a web application. It also includes a play to destroy all the created resources when they are no longer needed.
